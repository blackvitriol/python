# PixelSorting

Pixel sorting is an image processing technique creating a "digital pixel-glitch" effect. It was popularized (possibly invented) by artist Kim Asendorf who then provided the source code for it. The code orders the pixels in the rows/columns of an image. The rows/columns of the image are split into ‘intervals’. Then the pixels in each interval are rearranged so as to sort them with respect to some property, say, lightness. [1] The code has been ported into Python by satyarth [2]

*** I did not have a really great picture to try it on, and didn't feel like applying it on a random picture.***
